When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
In case you want to share your project with other people who may also contribute to it. 

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In order to control the status of the local repository. Changes in the remote repository
might have been made by other contributors. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When yould you use one instead
of the other?
I would use forks for starting a project based on existing one. Clones for copying the project

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
To be able to work oflline with the latest changes in the online repository. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would
be harder?

I would create a shared folder for all the collaborators. Usage would be easier, tracking and 
synchronization of changes would be much more difficult. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in the master?
What benefits does each approach have?

A separate branch is needed in case of collaborations, since changes into the master
should be reviewed by others.
